# SUBTUBE

![](https://tokei.rs/b1/github/nagy135/tabber?category=code)

Simple script that allows you to collect screenshots of part of screen.

# Explanation
I made this script to steal tabs from youtube videos where actual pdfs are behind pay-wall.
After a while i began organizing my tabs in folder created by this script and use it to store tabs from free sources as well.

# Modes
## single
1. lets you select part of screen
1. asks for **tab name**
1. saves in folder
1. notifies using notify-send

## multiple
1. lets you select part of screen
1. asks for **folder name**
1. using different cli option lets you screenshot the same part of screen multiple times (forward video => screen => repeat)
1. notifies using notify-send
